# Rapid Prototyping for Data Projects with AI, Loveable & Streamlit

A hands-on workshop where you'll build a working prototype of a data-driven app or dashboard in small groups — going from idea to implementation in a single session.

You'll leave with a **working prototype** and a **repeatable workflow** for AI-assisted rapid prototyping.

## What You'll Build

Using two complementary tools:
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** — Python-native framework for building interactive data apps and dashboards with minimal code
- **[Loveable](https://lovable.dev/)** — AI-powered no-code platform for rapid frontend prototyping and full-stack app generation

You'll pick one of three example project briefs (or bring your own dataset/idea) and prototype it live.

## Workshop Timeline (2 Hours)

| Time | Phase | What Happens |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 0:00–0:15 | **Setup & Kickoff** | Intro, form groups, pick a brief |
| 0:15–0:30 | **Ideation** | Define your prototype scope using AI prompts |
| 0:30–1:15 | **Build Sprint** | Hands-on prototyping with Streamlit and/or Loveable |
| 1:15–1:40 | **Polish & Iterate** | Refine your prototype, add interactivity |
| 1:40–2:00 | **Show & Tell** | Groups demo their prototypes |

See [`guides/AGENDA.md`](guides/AGENDA.md) for the detailed facilitation guide.

## Pre-Workshop Setup

Please complete these steps **before** the workshop so we can jump straight into building.

### Required

1. **Laptop with internet access**
2. **GitHub account** — [Sign up](https://github.com/signup)
3. **Access to any LLM** — No subscription needed. Free tiers work fine (output quality varies by model). Options:
   - [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) (free tier)
   - [Claude](https://claude.ai/) (free tier)
   - [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) (free tier)
4. **Loveable account** — [Sign up with GitHub](https://lovable.dev/) (free tier available)
5. **Streamlit account** — [Sign up with GitHub](https://streamlit.io/) (free tier available)

### For Streamlit (recommended)

If you want to run Streamlit locally:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/rchitralla/Rapid_Prototyping_Workshop.git
cd Rapid_Prototyping_Workshop

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r examples/streamlit/requirements.txt

# Test that it works
streamlit run examples/streamlit/app.py
```

Alternatively, you can use **Streamlit Community Cloud** to run the app directly from GitHub — no local setup needed.

### Nice to Have (not required)

- **Wireframing tool** for quick sketches before building:
  - [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) (no registration needed)
  - Miro or Lucidchart (if you have accounts)

## Project Briefs

Choose one of these three briefs, or bring your own dataset/idea.

### Brief 1: Startup Funding Explorer
> **Dataset:** `datasets/startup_funding.csv`
>
> Build a dashboard that lets users explore startup funding rounds — filter by industry, funding stage, and amount. Include summary stats and a chart showing trends over time.

### Brief 2: Coffee Preferences Survey
> **Dataset:** `datasets/coffee_survey.csv`
>
> Create an interactive survey results viewer. Let users filter by demographics, show preference breakdowns, and visualize the most popular coffee types and brewing methods.

### Brief 3: City Bike-Share Analytics
> **Dataset:** `datasets/city_bikes.csv`
>
> Prototype a tool that analyzes bike-share trip data — show popular routes, peak usage times, and trip duration distributions. Bonus: add a map view.

## Language

The workshop will be held in **English**. Small groups are free to collaborate in **French** among themselves.
